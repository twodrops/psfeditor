Eclipse Project Set Editor

An Eclipse Project Set file (.psf) enables quick export and import of files from a repository like Git, SVN etc. Eclipse currently supports exporting files in a repository as a Project Set file. An editor for an existing PSF file is currently missing. The means updating an existing PSF file (for example, adding a new project, removing an existing project etc.) means editing PSF XML by hand!

The Project Set Editor provides a simple user interface to view and edit PSF files (similar to Manifest Editor or Target Definition Editor). The editor also allows directly importing the artifacts in a PSF file.
